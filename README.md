I have the 100% version of the game with independence and pagoda functions and each game board runs in under 10 seconds, tested on the cpsc lab computers. <br />

To run the game you must include name of the game in '' since some of my game names have spaces in them for example 'half dead'. <br />

To run game: <br />
peg('crossbow').<br />
peg('longbow').<br />
peg('not quite dead').<br />
peg('half dead').<br />
peg('almost dead').<br />
peg('full').<br />

When the game is run it first prints the starting board, then prints the goal board. Then it will search for the solution and then prints the steps. To go to the next step it will ask the user to press y. if you want to see the next step. To not see the next step and end the program you can press n. or anything but y then followed by a dot (.) for example n. or g. will end the game and not show you the next step.
